# Youngn's Modulus Calculation

# `youngs_mod.m` file
`youngs_mod.m` file contains the calculations for Young's Modulus, as well as plotting. The calculation is done using a linear regression with 2 degrees of freedom. Resulting parameters are stored within `E1.mat` - `E5.mat`.

# `E_i.mat`
Each `E_i.mat` file contains a calculated Young's modulus and its corresponding standard deviation. Detailed calculation is done using the function `lin_reg()` declared in `lin_reg.m`.

# `specimen_i.pdf`

Each `specimen_i.pdf` contains vector plots generated from `youngs_mod.m` file.
